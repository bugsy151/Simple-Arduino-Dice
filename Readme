The simple dice sketch for Arduino is an attempt to teach myself more coding skills without simply copying other code snippets 
or examples to achieve the goals of this project.

The simple dice sketch aims to create an electronic LED D6 (six sided) die with credible randomiszation to mimic real die throws

This sketch will serve to be the code base for more developed sketches for die throws with more features.
